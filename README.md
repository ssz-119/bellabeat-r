## Key Insights
- Many users still fall in the high risk sedentary lifestyle despite being physically active on paper.
- Users show high sleep efficiency (mean = 0.92) but insufficient sleep duration—averaging only about 6 hours per night.
- The “somewhat active” group had the highest proportion of users meeting recommended sleep levels, representing a realistic and balanced user profile.

## Business Recommendations
- Promote Consistent, Balanced Wellness Over Numeric Goals
- Highlight Sleep Tracking as a Core Feature
- Leverage “Somewhat Active” as the Ideal Lifestyle Tier
